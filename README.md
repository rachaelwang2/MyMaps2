## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I ran into a bug when implementing the CreateMap file, the program would shut down whenever I tried to zoom directly to the pins. I wasn't able to find a solution to this bug. Instead I decided to extended the opening view when entering a map into general North America.
